To optimize OpenZaak as much as possible, it must be connected with other systems or components. Some of the current ones are document management systems or specialized systems to handle permits, as well as the case handling component, MyApp or apps for MOR reports.</p>\n<p>OpenZaak consists of backend (storage and retrieval) and API (service) provisioning layer (authorization and authentication) for the national <a href=\"https://github.com/VNG-Realisatie/gemma-zaken\">Zaak Gericht Werken API</a>.</p>\n<p>OpenZaak is further developed in an open source environment by an open and active community of municipalities, vendors and software developers.
