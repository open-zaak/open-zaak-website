## Podcast interview: resolving vulnerabilities in OpenZaak

Several weeks ago, OpenZaak was featured in the livecast series ['Let's talk about Public Code'](https://podcast.publiccode.net/) from the [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net). The purpose of this show is to share stories of codebases that are working with Public Code from different viewpoints, (developers, vendors, civil servants, managers, etc.).

The episode dedicated to OpenZaak was focused on the developers point of view regarding a [vulnerability](https://github.com/publiccodenet/projects/issues/20) that was discovered, and resolved within the community and what learnings were taken from it. 

The interview with [Sergei Maertens](https://github.com/sergei-maertens), technical lead at [Maykin Media](https://github.com/maykinmedia) and [Tjerk Vaags](https://github.com/TjerkVaags), developer at [Contezza](https://contezza.nl/), is available in different formats:

- Watch it on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xojrumKgfA)
- [Periscope](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1gqxvoRWjgwKB)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/publiccodenet/videos/321846445885858/)
- Or you can just do the old school thing and listen it in [podcast format](https://podcast.publiccode.net/e/3-sergei-maertens-and-tjerk-vaags-openzaak/).
